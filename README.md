Various Projects I have completed

Washington State Trails -
This project was mainly a data visualization exercise. I pulled data on washington state trails, kept only the relevant data, performed k-means clustering on the dataset and showed results. Goal was to show I can pull data, evaluate it, perform analysis, and create a meaningful visualization using ggplot.
